Sure, I'll organize the study plan into a table for you, with the semesters as columns and the courses listed under each semester. Here's the structured representation of your study plan:

| Year/Semester         | Courses                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Third Year, 2nd Semester | IMSE2135, IMSE3134, IMSE4136, Caes9532, (IMSE3102 not enrollable), BSTC2006 |
| Fourth Year, 1st Semester | IMSE2102, IMSE2132, IMSE4122, IMSE4135, IMSE3103, (IMSE3136 not found) |
| Fourth Year, 2nd Semester | IMSE4174, IMSE4138, IMSE3110, IMSE2113, IMSE3107, (one free elective available) |

Please note:
- For the Third Year, Second Semester, you mentioned `IMSE3102` is not enrollable.
- For the Fourth Year, First Semester, `IMSE3136` could not be found in the enrollment system.
- For the Fourth Year, Second Semester, there's one free elective available.
